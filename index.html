        <p>I'm a student, programmer, builder and a sporadic boxer.</p>  
        <p>I'm interested in technology, innovation and space for as long as I know, I think because they are most promising in answering the ages long question, "What is The Truth?" and "Why do we exist when there was a possibilty that we shouldn't exist?", which is much better phrased as "Why there is something instead of nothing".</p>
        <p>I'm pursuing my Bachelor's of Technology; and AI or Artificial Intelligence is what I am interested in most right now and spend most of my time on. It is truly exceptional that we are on the verge of building something that can not only be as intelligent as us humans but more, though how it progresses is also equally important.</p>
        <p>I like to spend my time making cool projects, reading books or watching tutorials on youtube. I like combat sports a lot and and apart from these things I practice boxing.</p>
