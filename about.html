    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I spend most of my time reading, coding and thinking.</p>
    <P>
        I have a burning passion for innovation and innovative things.
        I believe innovation is the most important thing and without it the there will be no difference b/w today and a century later
        and more important thing is to innovate things which are useful, and expands our consciousness.<br>
        And as Bob Dylan said, "If you are not busy being born, you're busy dying" and true it is.
